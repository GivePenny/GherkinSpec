# Credits

We're grateful to anyone asking questions, raising issues and contributing code on GivePenny's GherkinSpec project.  Everything asked or raised challenges us and improves the tooling.  Some key contributors that don't appear in our issues list or commit history are recognised here.

## Projects

* [The Cucumber project](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber) - There aren't many Gherkin language translations that we support today but the few that we do are based on Cucumber's translations file (although we extend this).
