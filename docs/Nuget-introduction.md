# GherkinSpec

## Overview

A lightweight, cross-platform .NET Standard test adapter that discovers Gherkin tests from feature files and executes them.  Inspired by the giants of Cucumber, SpecFlow and BDDfy, filling a niche between them for microservice tests that are both lightweight (e.g. BDDfy) yet self-documenting in a natural language (e.g. SpecFlow/Cucumber).

## Highlights

* Fully cross-platform (.NET Standard)
* No generated code files means cleaner pull requests (i.e. no *.Designer.cs)
* Use with any unit test framework or assertions library
* Supports dependency injection
